## ✨ What It Does

Refactron analyzes your Python code to find:
- **Security issues** - SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe code patterns
- **Performance problems** - N+1 queries, inefficient loops, slow patterns
- **Code smells** - Magic numbers, long functions, too many parameters
- **Complexity** - Deep nesting, high cyclomatic complexity
- **Type hints** - Missing or incomplete annotations
- **Dead code** - Unused functions and unreachable code

Then it helps you fix them with safe, previewable refactorings.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
pip install refactron
```

Analyze your code:
```bash
refactron analyze myproject/
```

Get refactoring suggestions:
```bash
refactron refactor myfile.py --preview
```

Or use it in Python:
```python
from refactron import Refactron

refactron = Refactron()
analysis = refactron.analyze("mycode.py")
print(analysis.report())
```

## 📊 Features

### Security Analysis
Finds vulnerabilities like SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, and unsafe patterns. Includes context-aware analysis that understands when code is in test files vs production.

### Performance Analysis
Detects N+1 query problems, inefficient string concatenation in loops, redundant operations, and other performance bottlenecks that slow down your code.

### Code Quality
Identifies code smells, complexity issues, missing type hints, dead code, and dependency problems. Helps you maintain clean, maintainable code.

### Safe Refactoring
Preview changes before applying them. Each refactoring comes with a risk score so you know what's safe to apply automatically.

## 💡 Why Refactron?

- **Finds real issues** - Not just style problems, but actual bugs and performance issues
- **Safe by default** - Preview everything before applying changes
- **Context-aware** - Understands your code structure, not just syntax
- **Fast and reliable** - Analyzes thousands of lines in seconds
